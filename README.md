# Bike-Analysis-Report-Excel
## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze bike sales data to uncover insights and trends. The analysis covers various aspects such as sales performance, customer demographics, and product preferences.

## File Description
Bike Sales Analysis.xlsx: This Excel file contains the raw data used for the analysis. It includes multiple sheets with detailed information on bike sales.
This file has Main sheet which has all the raw data. There is a sheet for Pivot Table and Charts which are the data visualizations for the raw data. The Dashboard sheet is where all the charts are represented together.

## Data Cleaning Process
1. **Removal of Duplicate Values:**
   
   -Identified and removed duplicate entries to ensure each record is unique and to prevent skewed analysis results.
   
   -Standardizing and Removing Null Values:

2. **Replaced or removed null values to maintain data integrity.**

   -Standardized data entries to ensure consistency across the dataset (e.g., converting 'N/A', 'null', or blanks to a standard representation).

3. **Standardizing the Data:**

   -Ensured currency values are properly formatted with appropriate commas and decimal places for consistency and readability.

4. **Finding and Replacing Abbreviations:**

   -Identified and replaced all abbreviations with their full forms to avoid ambiguity (e.g., converting 'S' to 'Single', 'M' to 'Married').
   
5. **Merge Two datasets:**

   -The Ethnicity column is an additional add-on column from another data set added into this data using the ID. Utilised Vlook-up function to merge this.

## Key Findings
1. **Age Bracket Influencing Bike Purchase**
 - Adults are the most significant purchasers of bikes, followed by Young Adults and then Seniors.
 - This suggests that marketing efforts could be focused more on adults as they form the largest customer base.
2. **Commute Distance to Bike Purchase**
 - People living within 0-1 Miles and those within 5-10 Miles are the most frequent purchasers.
 - This may indicate that bikes are popular both for short local commutes and for slightly longer distances, possibly for exercise or leisure.
3. **Total Bikes Purchased Based on Gender**
 - Males have a higher count of bike purchases compared to females.
 - This trend indicates a higher interest or need among males, which could guide targeted marketing strategies.
4 **Average Income Per Purchase**
 - Individuals with higher income levels tend to purchase more bikes.
 - Males on average have a higher income per purchase than females.
 - This could suggest that higher-income groups, particularly males, are a key market segment.
5. **Bike Purchase as per Ethnicity and Age Group**
 - Across Adult, Senior, and Young Adult age groups, White and Asian ethnicities show a higher number of bike purchases.
 - This might indicate cultural preferences or economic factors influencing bike purchases within these ethnic groups.
   
## Key Takeaways:
1. Age Group Targeting: Focus on Adults for the primary marketing, with secondary focus on Young Adults.
2. Distance Marketing: Emphasize convenience and benefits for short local commutes and slightly longer distances.
3. Gender-Specific Campaigns: Consider more targeted campaigns towards males but also explore opportunities to increase female participation.
4. Income-Based Strategies: Promote higher-end bikes to higher income brackets, particularly targeting males.
5. Ethnic Group Preferences: Tailor marketing strategies considering the higher purchase rates among White and Asian ethnic groups.
